# Who Wants To Be A Pokemon Master

## Introduction

An updated version of my first project (see original https://github.com/kawaharm/who-wants-to-be-a-pokemon-master) using React and Material UI. 
Blending two of my childhood pastimes, I proudly present: **WHO WANTS TO BE A POKEMON MASTER!** A crossover of the hit tv show _Who Wants To Be A Millionaire_ and popular video game franchise _Pokemon_, players choose Pikachu to take the hot seat against the original show host Regis Philbin as they answer multiple-choice questions using a RPG battle system similar to the Generation I Pokemon games. Each correct answer depletes a portion of the host's health points and gets you one step closer to victory. But beware, one wrong answer and your journey ends, sending you straight to the Pokemon Center to tend to your fainted Pikachu. So, do you have what it takes to be the next Pokemon Master?

## How To Play

GAME: https://kawaharm.github.io/pokemon-master-react/

1. At the Start Screen, enter your name and click LET'S PLAY or hit Enter.
2. In the Main Menu, there are four buttons:
   - **PLAY:** Unveils 4 answer choices to the question. Players choose which of the four is the correct answer and will be asked "Is that your final answer?" before continuing. Answering correctly will deplete a portion of the host's HP and take the player to the next question. Answer incorrectly, the game is over.
   - **HELP:** Instructions/How To Play
   - **HINT:** Pick from two "Lifelines", each that can only be used once throughout the entire game.
     - 50-50: _Removes two random incorrect answer choices_
     - Call A Trainer: _A very intellectual trainer tells you the correct answer_
   - **RUN:** Quit the game and return back to the Start Screen.
3. Keep answering correctly until the host's HP is completely drained.
4. Claim your title as a Pokemon Master!
